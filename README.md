# PAYDAY-2-Hashlist Mod

Based of https://bitbucket.org/Frankelstner/pd2-hashlist/overview
Added more paths using the mod provided in here.

Make sure to edit the path for your extract.

You need to bind a key to run the paths finder, it can take a while (max 15/20 min) so read in the script to do more specific things.

Afterwards, you can filter the list using another binded key. You need to play a file named 'hashlist' (preferablly the final hashlist) and it will remove any duplicates.
